Assignment 2 for NTU EE6509 Renewables Energy Systems In Smart Grids

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: More energy storage systems, such as batteries, supercapacitors,
hydrogen, and hybrid systems, will be deployed in various applications in the future such
as those in electric vehicles, and building & grid utilization. We need timely solutions for
emerging scientific and technical challenges in energy storage transportation systems and
smart grids. The objectives of this assignment are the followings.
• Study vehicle-to-grid (V2G) infrastructure and interactions with energy storage systems.
• Existing V2G platforms and standards.
• Develop an application of AI and machine learning to energy storage for transportation
and power grids.

Our solution for the problem is structured into the following components: 
1.	Nominal Energy Consumption Prediction: We use an LSTM model to predict nominal grid energy consumption (excluding EVs) every 5 minutes over the past 24 hours.
2.	Optimization algorithm: This algorithm manages EV charging and discharging based on user availability, grid conditions, and battery health.
